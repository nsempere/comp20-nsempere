Time Spent on this project: 5 Hours

Note: In working on this project, I collaborated with Alice Lee,
	  with whom I discussed loading a unique sprite as a map marker,
	  and with Nick Yan, with whom I discussed some issues with loading 
	  the map page that I had.

All parts of the project have been implememnted correctly apart from one 
very small detail: my personal map marker loads both a sprite AND the 
standard google maps marker to the page. I specify the URL for the icon
field in the marker setup but it doees not sem to overwrite the default 
marker.
