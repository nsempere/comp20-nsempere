This repository hold the remainder of my coursework for Comp 20. Each
directory in the repository represents the files associated with one
assignment.

My work in this class has proven integral to my growth as a developer. It
has given me insight both into the various technologies used to build web
applications today and into the processes by which I learn about those
technologies best. The course itself, however, has acted as a sampling
of several different areas of web development. In this repository, there
exist explorations in Web Design, client-side and server-side programming,
using open-source API's like Google Maps, web security, and more. 

Though most of these topics have been intriguing, there are two that I hope
to study in further detail: web security and AJAX. Both strike me as powerful 
concepts that have been and will continue to be imperative to the growth
and improvement of the web technologies that exist today. For that reason,
I would say that I enjoyed assigment 2, which can be found in the mmap folder
of the repository, most. It was heavily dependent on asynchronous data processing
forced me to research other technologies (namely, the Google Maps API). More
indirectly, it acted as a fascinating tool for considering what damage a client 
like this one has the potential to deal to a server that is not adequately 
prepared.
