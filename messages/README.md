Loading the absolute URL:

	As it turns out, loading the absolute URL in place
	of "data.json" does not work. It wiolates the same origin
	policy, so the request will never go through. Loading
	"data.json" worked because it is a relative url and is 
	located in the same domain as index.html.  


NOTE:I accidentally modified the HTML page and them promptly 
     undid it. I had two index.html pages for different things
     open at the same time and mixed the two up. Now, the page
     should be exactly as it was.
