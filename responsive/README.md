This directory holds the index.html and the stylesheet I designed to
practice creating responsive web pages.

At the moment, The images do not actually appear. I use a background
attribute  to display the image and include a URL to software.png and then
specify the pixel  coordinate I would like to start displaying from. I then
specify a height and width that the image should display. However, for reasons
that I cannot yet infer,  this method doesn't seem to be displaying an image.
